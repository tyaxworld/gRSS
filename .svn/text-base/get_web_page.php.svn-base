/**
 * Get a file on the web.  The file may be an (X)HTML page, an image, etc.
 * Return an associative array containing the page header, contents,
 * and HTTP status code.
 *
 * Values in the returned array are as defined by the CURL curl_getinfo()
 * function, and include:
 *
 * 	"url"		the last effective URL after redirects
 * 	"http_code"	the last error/status code
 * 	"content_type"	the content type from the header
 *
 * This function adds a few more:
 *
 * 	"content"	the page content (text, image, etc.)
 * 	"errno"		the CURL error code
 * 	"errmsg"	the CURL error message
 *
 * On success, "errno" is 0, "http_code" is 200, and "content" has the
 * web page.
 *
 * On an error with the URL, such as a redirect limit, or timeout,
 * "errno" will be non-zero and "errmsg" will contain an error message.
 * There other fields will be missing.
 *
 * On an error with the web site, such as a missing page, no permissions,
 * or no service, "errno" will be 0, "http_code" will be the HTTP error
 * code, and "content" will be missing.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * 	url		the URL of the page to get
 *
 * Return values:
 * 	An associative array containing the page text and error codes,
 * 	as described above.
